# mSL bot for IRC
My old IRC bot written in mSL, has user management with 3 groups, ascii art, API calls to multiple popular services, etc. 

1. add this these files to your scripts folder for mIRC or adIIRC
2. go to the editor -> users tab -> add yourself an owner:user!ident@host
3. go to botmaster.ini and add yourself to make yourself an owner, there are several examples already available
4. go to owner.ini and add yourself the same way
