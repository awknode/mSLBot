# mSL bot for IRC
My old IRC bot written in mSL, has user management with 3 groups, ascii art, API calls to multiple popular services, etc. 

1. add this these files to your scripts folder for mIRC or adIIRC
2. go to the editor -> users tab -> add yourself an owner:user!ident@host
3. go to botmaster.ini and add yourself to make yourself an owner, there are several examples already available
4. go to userlist.ini and add yourself the same way

From here you can do whatever you'd like with the bot, type $sshelp for more instructions. It's not all the bot can do but it's a start to documentation.
